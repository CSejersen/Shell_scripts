A collection of shell scripts written for fun and convenience.

## Spotify Scripts Setup
For the spotify scripts to work, it is neccesary to first create an app on the spotify developer site.
in the `/spotify/auth_scripts/` folder you need to create a file with your client_secret and name it `secret.txt`. 
Now run the server with flask, and get your authorization code by visiting the url generated by the `generate_auth_link.sh` script. 
After visiting the link your authentication code is stored in `/spotify/auth_scripts/auth_code.txt` 
After this, run get_token.sh to get a **refresh_token**. This token will be used to get new auth_tokens from Spotify. Each new auth tokens lasts one hour.
your refresh token is generated and stored in `/spotify/auth_scripts/refresh_token.txt`

The setup is now done. To get a fresh token simply execute the `refresh_token.sh` script. Do this before calling the API with any of the other scripts.
