# My Shell Scripts
A collection of shell scripts written for fun and convenience.

## Spotify Scripts Setup
For the spotify scripts to work, it is neccesary to first create an app on the spotify developer site.
in the `/spotify/auth_scripts/` folder you need to create a file with your client_secret and name it `secret.txt`. 
After this run the server with flask, and get your authorization code by visiting the url generated by the `generate_auth_link.sh` script. 
The code is then added to a file called `auth_code.txt` in `/spotify/auth_scipts/`.
After this you can run get_token to get an authentication token that lasts for 1 hour. The first time this is done you need to save the
refresh_token you get from the request in a file called `refresh_token.txt` in `/spotify/auth_scripts/`. This is permanent and it is used to generate new tokens.

The setup is now done. To get a fresh token simply execute the `refresh_token.sh` script.
